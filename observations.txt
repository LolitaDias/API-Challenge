Observations:
1. Latitude vs. Temperature: 
    (a) The distance from Equator affects the temperature.
    (b) If the city is farther away, the temperature is colder.
    (c) If the city is closer to the equator, the temperature is warmer.

2. Latitude vs. Humidity: 
    (a) Needs additional analysis, may be addition of Temperature as a parameter can help us derive better observations.
    
3. Latitude vs. Cloudiness:
    (a) Needs additional analysis, no observation can be made with the available information.
    
4. Latitude vs. Wind Speed: 
    (a)Windspeeds seem to be high at latitudes furthest from the equator.
